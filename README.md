# AccessAI Android SDK

[![CI](https://github.com/Caculuz-cinks/accessai-android-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Caculuz-cinks/accessai-android-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A voice-first, TalkBack-friendly accessibility layer for Android apps. Developers register the actions their app
allows (check balance, send money, read transactions); blind and low-vision users can then do those things by
speaking or typing, with every sensitive action read back and explicitly confirmed.

**The AI only interprets. It never executes.** Your handlers run your business logic, and only after AccessAI's
deterministic checks pass.

Part of AccessAI:

| Repo | What |
|---|---|
| **accessai-android-sdk** (this) | Kotlin SDK: action registry, dialog engine, speech, accessible Compose UI |
| [accessai-server](https://github.com/Caculuz-cinks/accessai-server) | AI service: interpretation, confirmation tokens |
| [accesspay-demo](https://github.com/Caculuz-cinks/accesspay-demo) | Demo fintech app + mock bank that integrate this SDK |

## Modules

| Module | Contents | Needs Android? |
|---|---|---|
| `accessai-core` | Action DSL and registry, `DialogEngine` (the conversation and safety logic), confirmation flow, amount parsing, naira speech formatting, HTTP client, offline `LocalRulesBackend` | No (pure Kotlin/JVM) |
| `accessai-android` | `AccessAI` entry point, `AccessAIController`, speech recognition, text-to-speech, TalkBack-aware announcements | Yes |
| `accessai-compose` | `AccessAIModeScreen`, `AccessAIConsentScreen`, `AccessAIToggleButton`, `AccessAIScreen`, high-contrast `AccessAITheme` | Yes |
| `sample` | Minimal host app with simulated funds; CI builds it into an installable APK | Yes |

## Quick start

See [docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md). The service contract is in [docs/API_CONTRACT.md](docs/API_CONTRACT.md).

```kotlin
implementation("com.github.Caculuz-cinks.accessai-android-sdk:accessai-compose:0.1.0")
```

## How a transfer flows

1. User: "Send 5k to David." The SDK sends the text, the current screen and your action manifest to `/v1/interpret`.
2. The service suggests `transfer_money {recipient: "David", amount_minor: 500000}`.
3. Your resolver finds two Davids → "I found 2 matches: David Adeyemi or David Okafor. Which one?"
4. Your validator checks the balance. The SDK reads back: "You are about to send five thousand naira to David Adeyemi,
   account ending 2 3 9 1. Say "confirm transfer" to continue, or "cancel" to stop."
5. Only "confirm transfer" (or the Confirm button) counts. "Yes", "okay", silence and "don't confirm" do not.
6. The service issues a signed, 60-second, single-use token bound to the exact parameters.
7. Your handler runs once with the token and an idempotency key. Success is announced only if it returns `Success`.

## Building

Android compilation, lint and the sample APK run in **GitHub Actions** (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`): every push and
pull request. Download the APK and AARs from the run's **Artifacts** section.

Locally you need only JDK 17 to build and test the core, which holds all of the conversation and safety logic:

```bash
./gradlew -PcoreOnly=true :accessai-core:test
```

## Status

v0.1.0, hackathon MVP. English only. Simulated funds only. Not a compliance certification.
